# üö® Acacia Platform Issues & Future Improvements

This document tracks architectural questions, potential improvements, and known limitations for the Acacia user-extensible app platform.

## üèó Architecture Questions

### Extension Discovery & Installation
- [ ] **Extension Marketplace UI**: How do users discover and browse available extensions?
- [ ] **Extension Store**: Should there be a centralized store or per-app extension catalogs?
- [ ] **Installation Flow**: What's the UX for installing extensions? One-click, configuration steps?
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: How to handle extensions that depend on other extensions?
- [ ] **Version Management**: How do users update extensions without breaking existing functionality?

### Database Schema Evolution
- [ ] **Schema Migrations**: When extensions update their database schema, how do we migrate existing user data?
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: How to ensure old user data works with new extension versions?
- [ ] **Schema Validation**: How to validate extension schemas before allowing table creation?
- [ ] **Data Cleanup**: When users uninstall extensions, how do we handle their data tables?
- [ ] **Storage Limits**: Should there be limits on extension data storage per user?

### Component Safety & Rendering
- [ ] **XSS Prevention**: How does the React wrapper safely render user components without XSS vulnerabilities?
- [ ] **Component Isolation**: Should user components run in sandboxed iframes or use React's built-in safety?
- [ ] **Style Conflicts**: How to prevent user component styles from breaking the host application?
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: How to measure and limit the performance impact of injected components?
- [ ] **Component Validation**: Should there be lint/validation rules for user-generated React components?

### Function Execution Environment
- [ ] **NPM Dependencies**: How do user functions access external packages? Pre-approved allowlist?
- [ ] **Memory Management**: How to prevent memory leaks from long-running user functions?
- [ ] **Error Boundaries**: How to prevent user function errors from crashing the entire application?
- [ ] **Secrets Management**: How do user functions securely access API keys and credentials?
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Should there be execution limits per user/extension?

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- [ ] **Function Result Caching**: Cache results of expensive user functions based on input hash
- [ ] **Component Pre-compilation**: Pre-compile user React components for faster rendering
- [ ] **Extension Metadata Caching**: Cache extension configurations to reduce database queries
- [ ] **Database Query Optimization**: Implement query caching for extension table access
- [ ] **CDN Integration**: How to serve user-generated components from CDN?

### Scalability Concerns
- [ ] **VM Pool Management**: Optimize VM2 instance reuse and garbage collection
- [ ] **Database Connection Pooling**: Handle dynamic table creation without connection exhaustion
- [ ] **Horizontal Scaling**: How does the middleware scale across multiple server instances?
- [ ] **Load Testing**: Performance testing with hundreds of concurrent users and extensions
- [ ] **Memory Profiling**: Monitor memory usage of user functions and components

## üîí Security Considerations

### Code Execution Safety
- [ ] **Malicious Code Detection**: Scan user functions for potentially harmful patterns
- [ ] **Resource Limits**: Enforce CPU, memory, and execution time limits per function
- [ ] **Network Access Control**: Should user functions be able to make external HTTP requests?
- [ ] **File System Access**: Prevent user code from accessing server file system
- [ ] **Process Isolation**: Consider additional sandboxing beyond VM2

### Data Security
- [ ] **Data Encryption**: Should extension data be encrypted at rest?
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Log all extension data access for compliance
- [ ] **GDPR Compliance**: Handle user data deletion requests across extension tables
- [ ] **Cross-Extension Data Access**: Ensure extensions can't access other extensions' data
- [ ] **Admin Oversight**: Tools for app administrators to monitor extension activity

## üé® User Experience

### Developer Experience
- [ ] **Local Development**: How do developers test extensions locally before publishing?
- [ ] **Debugging Tools**: Provide debugging interface for user functions and components
- [ ] **Documentation Generator**: Auto-generate docs from extension schemas and functions
- [ ] **Testing Framework**: Built-in testing tools for extension developers
- [ ] **IDE Integration**: VS Code extension for Acacia development?

### End User Experience  
- [ ] **Extension Configuration UI**: Visual interface for users to configure installed extensions
- [ ] **Usage Analytics**: Show users how their extensions are performing
- [ ] **Extension Conflicts**: Detect and resolve conflicts between multiple extensions
- [ ] **Rollback Mechanism**: Allow users to quickly disable problematic extensions
- [ ] **Permission System**: Granular permissions for what extensions can access

## üõ† Technical Debt & Improvements

### Database Support
- [x] **Multi-Database Support**: Support both PostgreSQL and SQLite as requested
- [ ] **Database Abstraction**: Abstract database operations to support more databases (MySQL, MongoDB?)
- [ ] **Migration Tools**: Tools to migrate extension data between database types
- [ ] **Backup Strategy**: Automated backups of extension data

### Code Quality
- [ ] **TypeScript Strictness**: Improve type safety across all components
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user-friendly error messages
- [ ] **Logging Infrastructure**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Unit and integration tests for all core functionality
- [ ] **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and architectural guides

### Deployment & Operations
- [ ] **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes deployment configurations
- [ ] **Monitoring & Alerting**: Application performance monitoring and alerts
- [ ] **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health check endpoints
- [ ] **Graceful Shutdowns**: Handle shutdowns without losing user data
- [ ] **Auto-Scaling**: Scale middleware based on extension load

### Integration Patterns
- [ ] **Webhook Support**: Allow extensions to register webhooks for external integrations  
- [ ] **Event System**: Pub/sub system for extensions to communicate with each other
- [ ] **API Gateway Integration**: Work with existing API gateways and load balancers
- [ ] **Authentication Providers**: Support multiple auth providers (Auth0, Firebase, etc.)
- [ ] **SSO Integration**: Single sign-on for enterprise deployments
