## Abstract
A concise summary (1–2 paragraphs) of the problem, your solution, and why it matters.
Think: *What is this project, why now, and who benefits?*

Software and specifically SaaS has changed a lot in the past couple of years. As of last year the biggest thing out of anyone's mouth was that SaaS was dead, coding is dead, everyone will build their own software with agents and that will be that. As the AI boom sets in and people have begun experimenting with the tools and seeing the potential, I believe we have turned a corner on SaaS and are entering a new era. An era characterized by malleability, customization, and the importance of customer data. Current SaaS is rigid, crafted by cooks far away and limited by layers and layers of middle managers, engineers, marketing, and legal teams.

In the past a large part of my work has been building glue for different pieces of software to communicate with each others, which is an incredible waste of time for everyone involved. Shit breaks, has to be maintained, and is often not even used. This is where Acacia comes in. Acacia is an open-source platform that can be deployed alongside any SaaS application, allowing for customization and data integration without the need for extensive development or maintenance. It lets users make the app customizable without the need for engineering effort. Users keep their data, their existing software, and the workflow they know while building out custom features (think automated emails in a CRM, sending data from ServiceNow to Elasticsearch, calling the Slack/Discord API for meetings). Acacia is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing users to customize their experience and integrate with their existing systems.

AI coding agents have turned a corner and are now able to better integrate custom software, read docs, iterate, test, plan, and learn from their mistakes. This makes me very bullish on the future of coding agents and specifically their ability to get better over time. Malleable software is the future, custom app builders like Loveable have shown that anyone can go and build the software they need without engineers. Data has only gotten more valuable, at existing companies, machine learning and AI are becoming focal points of their strategy and this will only continue as the ease trends lower. Companies are adopting AI much faster than expected and I assume this trend will continue as productivity gains are realized.

## 1. Introduction
- Define the problem or challenge.
- Why it matters in the current context.
- Who is affected (developers, users, industry, research, etc.).

 Software creation has become easier and easier, and yet people are still using the same SaaS with the same features. This closed, outdated, and unchanged approach puts the burden on the user to adapt to the product rather than the product adapting to the user. This is the first time in history that this has ever been possible with something as simple as sending a slack message.

SaaS companies would love to introduce these customizable features to their customers, it will let them offer more custom solutions that fit everyone's needs and the recipient won't be stuck without features they were promised in the sales cycle. The problem is how do you store everyone's custom version of your software? Imagine having to maintain that. It's a nightmare. Imagine every company having to build out their own system of version control, deployment, and management for every user of every customer of every product.

Software companies will be most affected by this change as they can offer customizability to their customers without having to maintain it. Their customers get the flexibility to adapt the product to their needs, while also further cementing their usage of the product. Win-win!

## 2. Background & Current Landscape
- Existing solutions or alternatives.
- Their limitations.
- Why this area is ripe for innovation.

This comes down to 2 current interpretations of the future of the software and I will offer a third.

1. Everyone will build their own software \
I personally find this hard to believe because you don't own your data when using SaaS and transferring to a new custom software is difficult. Brand is still a key player here as well, selling security, trust, and one less thing they have to worry about. Sure you could have companies without an engineering department or with a small one build these softwares for internal use, but compliance and maintenance is one more thing. Furthermore I believe [companies suited for those domains will provide much more value efficiently than nonspecialized companies will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_competence), depending on the requirements of the product.

2. Everyone will migrate to a "malleable" piece of software \
This carries similar problems to the last solution, you still have trouble migrating and losing your data but your experience will be more custom and more adapted to your workflow. All in all, you get more benefits long term for the short term pain. AI will onboard you and adapt your CRM to fit all your needs and then some at the cost of getting to the platform.

This suprisingly doesn't give a way for adoption at companies currently using SaaS tools. Sure you can go and develop your own ticketing system/CRM but the road there is unpaved and dangerous depending on compliance needs. All these companies want to adopt AI broadly, they see the impact and the SaaS companies want to bring it to them. AI is useful, they can charge more and build less. As applications trend more and more towards malleable products, SaaS companies will need a way to do this effectively without further inconviencing their engineering team.
